# Commit-analysis

## Why this repository exists

This tool is aiming to analyze commit history in a git project and
generate useful statistics and insights to help teams identify deficiencies and
potential improvement points.

## Current state

Currently, 2 commands and a limited functionality are supported:

- `run` command generates csv files with the following insights:
  - `commit-analysis.csv` contains data about folder paths that appear to be
    coupled based on them being edited by the same commits in the commit history
- `show` command visualizes the csv files generated by the run
  command
